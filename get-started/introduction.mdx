## What is PayLink?

PayLink is an open-source framework designed to simplify payment integrations for AI agents by leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides a standardized interface for various payment providers, including M-Pesa and Airtel, enabling seamless integration of payment functionalities into your AI applications.


## How It Works

PayLink SDK connects to a PayLink MCP server via Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing your application to:

1. **Discover available payment tools** on the server
2. **Call payment tools** with appropriate arguments
3. **Process payment results** from the tools

The SDK handles all the communication details, so you can focus on integrating payment functionality into your application.

## Architecture Overview

The PayLink ecosystem consists of three main components:

1. **PayLink Server**: Hosts payment tools and connects to payment providers
2. **PayLink SDK**: Client libraries for connecting to the server
3. **Payment Providers**: External services like M-Pesa, Airtel, etc.
